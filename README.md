This has been improved since last revision
still need to update the graphics on my own
This app can now be accessed from a QR code meaning I am now able to make simple buisness cards I can give to people to easily give them my resume
I have also updated the resume with more relevant information
The app features 4 buttons each will take you to the desired tab
I plan on adding logos that when clicked will link you to my GitHub account and my LinkedIn Account
Also it somewhat works on mobile, the buttons work as intended but the box for them does somewhat leak off screen
Chatgbt was used for the design part as I cannot do graphic design to save my life
