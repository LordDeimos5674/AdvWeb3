# Resume Website

This is a website I made that I intend to use to help with hunting for jobs

## Technology Used

- ChatGPT assisted with the design of the website as I can not do graphic design to save my life
- No frameworks or external dependencies â€” just good old fashion HTML, CSS, and JS

## How to Start
- Open the Page itself to start no need for download

## Using the Website
- By clicking on each of the tabs you will be able to see the relevant information for each tab

## Features
### Odin Requirements
- None as this was an off on my own project that Me and my professor agreed would serve as Project 3
### Extra Features
- Currently it is accessable via QR and should work on mobile

## Future Work
- Planning on adding logos for Github and Linkedin that when clicked will link to the respected websites
- Possibly links to my project's themselves as well as more links to other important sites
- Make it look a bit nicer, it is very gray scale right now

## Learning Outcomes
- I learned a bit from how ChatGPT handled the graphic design as it funnily enough took the color pallette from my resume when I gave it to it for ideas on how to design a resume website
- Learned how to make QR Codes that would link to an "active" page
